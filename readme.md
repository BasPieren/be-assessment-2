## Installing
To install this application enter the following into your _terminal_:
```
git clone https://github.com/BasPieren/be-assessment-2.git

cd be-assessment-2

npm install
```

Then to start the server enter the following:  
```
node server
// or
nodemon server
```

### Database
After installing you will also have to create a MYSQL database as a place to store all data. I choose to use MySQL as a database because this is the first time worked with dynamic content and MySQL is the database that was used as example during lectures.

After you installed MySQL you have to login to your account:
```
mysql -u your-username -p
```

Then run the following SQL to create the database and enter it:
```
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS mydatingapp;

USE mydatingapp
```

After creating the database run the following SQL to create the users table. This is the place where we will store all users that register a account:
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  username TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  age TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  gender TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  description TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  picture TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  email TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  hash TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```
